        description: "Cannabis is a psychoactive drug from the cannabis plant used both medicinally and recreationally. It is smoked or ingested and users report feeling relaxed, happy, and hungry, along with pain relief. This comes at the risk of potential anxiety, paranoia, mild hallucination or even psychosis. There are many strains of Cannabis and each may significantly change the experience.",

            dosage: "Given the unpredictable purity and potency of street methamphetamine, it's essential to start with a low dose to assess your body's response. Each time you use a new batch, even from the same source, treat it as an unknown substance due to possible variations in potency. Regular breaks from use can help prevent tolerance build-up, requiring increasingly larger doses for the same effect. Be aware that dosing can be inconsistent when using different routes of administration, and transitioning from one method to another might require dosage adjustments. Above all, remember that it's easier to take more, but impossible to take less after the substance has been consumed. Due to these complexities, extreme caution and mindfulness are necessary when dosing methamphetamine.",

Taking a break between uses can stop you needing more and more each time. And always remember: it's easier to take more later, but you can't take less once it's in your system.
