THC, the primary psychoactive component in cannabis, interacts with the endocannabinoid system, which plays a significant role in the development and function of various brain regions. Research suggests that early, regular, and heavy cannabis use can disrupt normal neurodevelopmental processes, potentially leading to long-lasting cognitive deficits. This could impact functions like memory, attention, processing speed, and executive functions like decision-making. Given that the brain continues to develop into the mid-twenties, these risks are not limited to younger teenagers but also apply to young adults."},

Though the precise mechanisms remain under study, it is thought that chronic cannabis use may lead to alterations in various neurological processes, including neurotransmitter function and neural connectivity. Over time, these changes could contribute to depressive symptoms or make an individual more susceptible to developing a depressive disorder. This risk may be higher in individuals with a genetic predisposition to depression or those who began using cannabis at a young age. Additionally, the relationship between cannabis and depression may be bidirectional, with depression potentially leading to increased cannabis use, and vice versa, creating a vicious cycle that can be difficult to break."},

            name: "Cannabis",
            introduction: "Cannabis, also commonly known as marijuana, weed, or pot, is a psychoactive plant that has been used by humans for thousands of years. The plant contains various chemical compounds, with the most notable being tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). THC is primarily responsible for the 'high' or psychoactive effects, while CBD has therapeutic properties without causing a high.\n People consume cannabis in various forms - it can be smoked, vaporized, eaten in edibles, or applied topically. Its effects can include feelings of relaxation and euphoria, altered sensory perception, and increased appetite, but it can also cause anxiety or paranoia in some individuals. While not as harmful as some substances, misuse can still lead to mental health issues or dependency.",
            history: "Cannabis has a long history dating back thousands of years. Ancient cultures used it for medicinal and ritual purposes, and it's even been found in tombs from ancient Egypt. Modern use of cannabis, both recreationally and medicinally, has fluctuated in response to societal and legal changes. The 20th century saw periods of widespread use and severe criminalization. In recent years, there's been a shift towards legalization and recognition of its medicinal benefits in many parts of the world. Despite this, legal status and public opinion on cannabis use vary greatly between regions and cultures.",
            pharmacology: "Cannabis exerts its effects primarily through compounds called cannabinoids. The most well-known of these are THC and CBD. THC interacts with cannabinoid receptors in the brain to release dopamine, creating a feeling of euphoria. CBD, on the other hand, does not produce a high and is believed to interact with other receptors in the body, resulting in various potential therapeutic effects.\n However, chronic, heavy use of cannabis can lead to alterations in the brain's reward system, potentially leading to dependence. Additionally, THC can have varying effects on different individuals, and in some cases may increase anxiety or induce a state of paranoia. Understanding the pharmacology of cannabis helps underline the importance of moderation and responsible use.",
            effects: "When you use cannabis, you might feel relaxed, happy, and your senses may seem more intense â€“ like colors being brighter and food tasting better. Your thoughts might jump around, and time might feel like it's slowing down. Everyone's experience can vary, and the effects can depend on the strain of cannabis (Indica strains are usually more relaxing, while Sativa strains can be energizing).",
            comedown: "After the high of cannabis wears off, you might feel tired or a bit foggy. You could feel hungry â€“ people often call this the \"munchies\". Some people might feel a bit anxious or paranoid, but this usually passes. Rest, hydration, and a good meal can usually help you feel normal again.",
            overdose: "Overdoing it with cannabis is usually not dangerous, but it can be uncomfortable. You might feel paranoid or anxious. You could feel dizzy, have a fast heart rate, or even feel like you're \"greening out\" â€“ this is when you feel sick, sweaty, and might throw up. The best thing to do is try to relax, find a quiet place where you can lie down, and remember that these feelings will pass. It can help to have someone around who knows what's happening and can keep an eye on you.",
            dosage: "Cannabis is often smoked or ingested. While ingesting cannabis is better for your lungs, it is often longer lasting and more intense. When dosing cannabis, always start with a small amount. If it's an edible, wait at least two hours before having more as the effects can sneak up on you. If you're smoking, take breaks between hits to let the high set in. Always remember: you can always have more, but you can't have less once it's taken.",
            interactions: "Cannabis interactions are an important consideration for users. Combining cannabis with other substances can influence its effects, potentially heightening certain health risks or altering the drug's effectiveness. The chart below details specific interactions between cannabis and other substances. Please note that this information should be used for harm reduction purposes, and combining substances should always be approached with extreme caution.",
            testing: "For substances like cannabis, reagent testing is a key step for harm reduction. This process allows for the identification of any unexpected substances that might have been added, thereby helping avoid potential adverse effects. Given the increasing prevalence of synthetic cannabinoids, it's important to verify the contents of your cannabis. The Duquenois-Levine reagent is often used to confirm the presence of cannabinoids. Additionally, testing for fentanyl, a highly potent and dangerous opioid, is also becoming crucial due to instances of cross-contamination. Fentanyl test strips can be used to identify this potentially lethal adulterant.",
            legality: "Cannabis laws vary significantly by country and even within countries. While some countries have decriminalized or legalized cannabis for medical or recreational use, others continue to enforce strict prohibitions. Here's a brief overview of cannabis laws in some countries:",

Once the peak euphoria starts to fade, you will have a biological response to crave more. This is the same system that makes you crave food, sex, and anything pleasurable in life and is extremely hard to fight against. This feeling tends to disappear as soon as you have fully come down around the 10-12 hour mark (and in fact the thought of redosing actually starts to feel kinda gross). You simply need to endure through a few hours of cravings and then youâ€™re home free. Not to mention that redosing will amplify your comedown side effects exponentially. Itâ€™s simply NOT worth it when you could just eat, sleep, and have an awesome time dosing the next morning instead."

                body: "Most stimulants suppress appetite heavily and its actually surprisingly easy to begin starving by accident during a long binge. In fact, many people are shocked to discover that the vast majority of the 24-hour comedown symptoms of meth and amphetamines are actually just a result of poor nutrition or hydration. What helps a lot is setting an alarm to go off on your phone every 2 hours from the moment you dose to remind you to eat and drink. It sounds silly, but when youâ€™re peaking on stimulants you can easily get locked into whatever youâ€™re doing, sometimes for hours or days. This alarm will shift your focus away from whatever youâ€™re doing and provide an opportunity to break away and grab a snack with a glass of water. I know itâ€™s easy to eat a ton of fruit and sweets while on stimulants, but please try to eat a variety of nutritious food instead. When all else fails, a big glass of milk is an excellent source of protein and nutrients."

A lot of people think this is just due to excessive sweating, but it is actually a byproduct of rhabdomyolysis happening in your body and is a clear sign that you need to eat ASAP. When you take a stimulant that suppresses appetite you often donâ€™t eat much (potentially for days) and so your body needs to look elsewhere for energy and nutrients. It does this by metabolizing your own muscles into protein, resulting in the loss of that muscle. The byproduct of this is ammonia, which is toxic to your body. As a result, your body tries to get rid of it as quick as possible, either through urine or sweat. This can also happen from dehydration as well, though eating usually gives your body some water as well. If you follow tip #2 you will notice that you donâ€™t smell horrible at the end of the day (apart from the regular body odor that comes with sweating)."

As a result, long binges or daily use can lead people down a dangerous road to starvation without even realizing it. If you find yourself in a situation like this, you need to pay attention to the other ways that your body is trying to signal to you that it desperately needs food. Often these signals can â€˜seemâ€™ like a need to redose, but this is misguided. If you suddenly find that your high has started to take a more anxious, numb, or unpleasant experience, this likely is a sign! "

High doses can dramatically increase heart rate and blood pressure, potentially causing heart arrhythmia, acute heart damage, or a sudden increase in blood pressure that can result in a hemorrhagic stroke [5]. Overdose can also lead to hyperthermia or severe seizures [6]. Because methamphetamine is often used in a binge pattern, the risk of fatal overdose increases with each additional dose [7]. Recognizing signs of an overdose, such as chest pain, extreme agitation, or seizures, and seeking immediate medical attention can save lives [8]."},
            {header: "Neurotoxicity", body: "Methamphetamine is neurotoxic, meaning it can cause significant damage to brain cells [9]. It does so primarily by increasing the release and blocking the reuptake of the neurotransmitter dopamine, leading to high levels in the brain [10]. Over time, this can cause damage to the neurons that produce and use dopamine, leading to long-term cognitive deficits [11]. Symptoms of this neurotoxicity can include impairments in memory, attention, and decision-making, and motor coordination. In severe cases, it can result in symptoms similar to Parkinson's disease [12]. The neurotoxic effects of methamphetamine can persist even after discontinuation of the drug, highlighting the importance of harm reduction strategies and treatment interventions [13]."},
            {header: "Psychosis", body: "Methamphetamine-induced psychosis is a severe mental health risk associated with methamphetamine use. It can manifest as hallucinations, delusions, and extreme paranoia [14]. This happens due to the drug's profound effect on dopamine, a neurotransmitter heavily involved in our perception of reality and response to external stimuli [15]. High levels of dopamine can distort these processes, leading to psychotic symptoms [16]. These symptoms can persist even after discontinuation of methamphetamine and may require treatment with antipsychotic medications [17]. It's worth noting that individuals with pre-existing susceptibility to psychotic disorders are at a particularly high risk of experiencing psychosis with methamphetamine use [18]."},

            name: "Methamphetamine",
            introduction: "Methamphetamine, often known simply as 'meth', is a highly potent and addictive psychoactive drug. It typically takes the form of a white, odorless, and bitter-tasting crystalline powder. There are various methods of intake, including swallowing, snorting, smoking, or injecting. Meth stimulates the brain, resulting in a rush of energy and focus, but it can also induce feelings of anxiety, irritability, and paranoia. Despite its potent high, meth is a highly dangerous and illegal substance in many jurisdictions, primarily due to its potential for addiction, health damage, and societal harm.",
            history: "The history of methamphetamine dates back to the late 19th century, when it was first synthesized. Its powerful stimulating effects led to its use by soldiers in World War II to combat fatigue and enhance focus. However, the long-term consequences became increasingly apparent post-war, leading to growing concerns about its safety. By the 1960s, meth had permeated into the realm of recreational drug use and quickly gained notoriety for its intense high and addictive nature. Subsequently, it was criminalized in many regions. Despite legal restrictions, methamphetamine use spread globally, often wreaking havoc in communities due to its association with crime, social decay, and severe health issues.",
            pharmacology: "At a biological level, methamphetamine works by altering the chemical landscape of the brain. It primarily boosts the release of dopamine, a neurotransmitter responsible for feelings of pleasure and reward. This flood of dopamine is what produces the intense euphoria associated with meth use. It also releases serotonin and norepinephrine, although this occurs in much smaller amounts compared to the dopamine release.\n However, repeated meth use disrupts normal brain function. It can deplete the brain's own dopamine reserves and damage the brain's ability to naturally produce and regulate dopamine. Over time, this results in a reduced ability to experience pleasure without the drug, leading to dependence and addiction.\n Further, chronic meth use can damage other areas of the brain as well, impairing cognitive functions like memory and learning, and contributing to mental health issues such as depression and anxiety. Some of this damage may be permanent or take years of abstinence to heal. The comprehensive impact of methamphetamine on the brain illustrates the profound risks associated with its use.",
            effects: "When you take meth, it can make you feel extremely energetic, focused, and euphoric. You might talk a lot, move quickly, or feel like you don't need sleep or food. Some people may feel irritable or anxious. These effects typically last from six to twelve hours, but can be longer based on the dose and your body. Itâ€™s addictive nature makes compulsive redosing extremely likely.",
            comedown: "Coming down from meth can be tough. It often leads to extreme tiredness, depression, and increased appetite. You might have trouble sleeping and feel anxious, restless, or irritable. The comedown can last several days, and taking care of your body during this time - hydrating, eating, resting - is very important.",
            overdose: "A meth overdose can be life-threatening. Signs include chest pain, high body temperature, fast or irregular heartbeat, trouble breathing, and feeling really agitated or paranoid. In severe cases, it can lead to a stroke, heart attack, or death. If you think someone might be overdosing, this is a medical emergency. Stay with them and call for help right away.",
            dosage: "When it comes to taking meth, always start with a small dose, especially with a new batch. Itâ€™s critical to purchase a milligram scale in order to dose accurately. Be aware that dosing can be inconsistent when using different routes of administration, and transitioning from one method to another might require dosage adjustments. Taking a break between uses can stop you needing more and more each time. And always remember: it's easier to take more later, but you can't take less once it's in your system. So, go slow and be careful.",
            interactions: "Interactions with methamphetamine, a potent stimulant, can lead to severe health risks. Using meth in combination with other substances can amplify these risks, alter drug efficacy, and hasten dependency. Below, you'll find a detailed interactions chart for methamphetamine. Please note that this information should be used for harm reduction purposes, and combining substances should always be approached with extreme caution.",
            testing: "When using substances like methamphetamine, it's crucial to ensure the substance is what it is purported to be. Reagent testing can identify adulterants or substitute substances that may have been added, which can increase the risk of harmful effects or overdose. Particularly, testing for fentanyl, a potent opioid, is important given its increasing prevalence and high risk of overdose. Some of the key reagents for testing methamphetamine include the Marquis, Mecke, and Simon's reagents. Additionally, fentanyl test strips are recommended to identify the presence of this high-risk substance. The following chart contains links to each reagent:",
            legality: "Methamphetamine, often known as meth, is a highly potent stimulant which is controlled in almost all countries due to its high potential for abuse and serious health risks. Its use is primarily limited to prescription for very specific medical conditions under the brand name Desoxyn, and recreational use is illegal. Despite this, methamphetamine is often available through illicit markets.",
